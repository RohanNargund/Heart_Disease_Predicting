# Heart_Disease_Predicting
we had been provided with data using that data we have ploted different graph(bar graph) between target value and coloum value 
Then we found the relation between target value and coloum value
I have build it on the bases of linear classification algorithm
I have converted natural languange to machine level languange using onehotencoding 
Hence we can classify diseased and non diseased person
